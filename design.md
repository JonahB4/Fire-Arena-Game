# Game Design Ideas

## Movement

- Allow players to move using the cursor for easier control.
- Enable movement with arrow keys as an alternative.

## Gameplay

- **Enemy Behavior**:  
  No AI is needed if enemies simply follow the character. However, implementing a basic AI could add depth, making enemies feel like they have a "mind of their own."

- **Power-Ups**:  
  Have power-ups appear randomly over time, providing various boosts, such as:

  - Health recovery
  - Shields for protection
  - Speed boosts

- **Collisions**:  
  When collisions occur, players should be knocked back toward the edge of the arena.

- **1v1 Mode**:  
  Allow for a one-on-one mode, either locally or online.

  - **Local Play**: One player uses `WASD` for movement, and the other uses the arrow keys.

  - **Online Play**: Difficult to set up, but could be extremely fun,

    - have people be able to play via joining a game lobby, through a shared link, or room code

  - **Gameplay Style**: Consider a "beyblade" style where players can clash and try to knock each other out of the arena.

- **Difficulty Levels**:  
  Offer various difficulty settings for players:

  - Easy, Intermediate, Advanced, Difficult, Master, etc.

- **Arena Types**:
  Introduce different arena environments to enhance gameplay variety, such as:
  - Ice arena
  - Island arena
  - City arena
  - Apocalypse arena
